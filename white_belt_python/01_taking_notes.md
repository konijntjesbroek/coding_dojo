### Lesson One - Taking Notes Inside of Your Program

It is necessary to make notes as you create. These can serve a few different 
purposes. Maybe you need to think through the problem you are working on. 
Perhaps there is a bit of a joke in your variable names. Or you might want to
document what a piece of code is supposed to do so that when you get back to it
in a few weeks, months, or years. for python, there are a couple of ways this 
can be done.

\# a single line comment: Anything following a \# is ignored by the interpreter

''' or """" a multi-line comment: Anything between 2 sets of these types of 
marks is ignored by the interpreter but can be used to dynaically create
documentation for your program by development tools.

examples:

this = 12 # Setting this to 12
